  - questionInfo: Describe the components of a hemodialysis machine and their functions
      during the dialysis process.
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Blood pump, dialysate compartment, and waste container
    - Dialyzer, peristaltic pump, and blood pressure cuff
    - Blood reservoir, thermometer, and glucose monitor
    - Ultrafilter, IV infusion set, and oxygen concentrator
    correctAns: Blood pump, dialysate compartment, and waste container
  - questionInfo: During hemodialysis, what is the purpose of the dialyzer (artificial
      kidney), and how does it work?
    questionType: 0

    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - It regulates blood pressure during dialysis.
    - It monitors blood glucose levels during dialysis.
    - It filters and cleanses the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration.
    - It removes excess electrolytes using an electric pump.
    correctAns: It filters and cleanses the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration.
  - questionInfo: Explain the steps involved in preparing and connecting a patient
      to the hemodialysis machine.

    options:
    - Clean the patient's access site, connect bloodlines to the dialyzer, and start
      the machine.
    - Administer anesthesia, connect the catheter, and initiate the dialysate flow.
    - Check the patient's blood sugar levels, connect the oxygen supply, and start
      the pump.
    - Apply a cooling blanket, insert the peritoneal catheter, and flush the peritoneal
      cavity.
    correctAns: Clean the patient's access site, connect bloodlines to the dialyzer,
      and start the machine.
  - questionInfo: In peritoneal dialysis, what is the role of the peritoneal catheter,
      and how is it inserted into the patient?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - The catheter delivers the dialysis solution into the bladder through the urethra.
    - The catheter allows access to the bloodstream through an arteriovenous fistula.
    - The catheter is surgically inserted into the peritoneal cavity to deliver and
      drain the dialysis solution.
    - The catheter is placed into the intestines to facilitate nutrient absorption
      during dialysis.
    correctAns: The catheter is surgically inserted into the peritoneal cavity to
      deliver and drain the dialysis solution.
  - questionInfo: Differentiate between single-needle and double-needle hemodialysis
      techniques. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Single-needle technique requires less blood flow but is more time-consuming,
      while double-needle technique allows higher blood flow rates but requires more
      vascular access.
    - Single-needle technique is preferred for patients with high blood pressure,
      while double-needle technique is suitable for patients with diabetes.
    - Single-needle technique is used for in-center hemodialysis, while double-needle
      technique is used for home hemodialysis.
    - Single-needle technique uses a catheter for access, while double-needle technique
      uses an arteriovenous graft.
    correctAns: Single-needle technique requires less blood flow but is more time-consuming,
      while double-needle technique allows higher blood flow rates but requires more
      vascular access.
