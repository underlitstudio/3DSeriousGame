    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - To prevent diabetes
    - To restore kidney function
    - To regulate blood pressure
    - To filter and remove waste products from the blood
    correctAns: To filter and remove waste products from the blood
  - questionInfo: 'Name the two main types of dialysis used for patients: hemodialysis
      and peritoneal dialysis. What is the primary difference between the two?'

    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Hemodialysis uses a catheter, and peritoneal dialysis uses an AV fistula.
    - Hemodialysis is done at home, and peritoneal dialysis is done in a dialysis
      center.
    - Hemodialysis filters blood outside the body, and peritoneal dialysis filters
      blood inside the body.
    - Hemodialysis is more expensive than peritoneal dialysis.
    correctAns: Hemodialysis filters blood outside the body, and peritoneal dialysis
      filters blood inside the body.
  - questionInfo: Define the term "ultrafiltration" in the context of dialysis.

    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - The process of removing excess electrolytes during dialysis
    - The use of a high concentration of dialysate in peritoneal dialysis
    - The movement of water and small solutes across a semipermeable membrane during
      dialysis
    - The addition of drugs to the dialysis solution to treat infections.
    correctAns: The movement of water and small solutes across a semipermeable membrane
      during dialysis
  - questionInfo: What are the common indications for initiating dialysis in a patient
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)?

    options:
    - Mild fatigue and occasional edema
    - Severe acute kidney injury
    - GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) > 60 ml/min
    - GFR < 15 ml/min or symptoms of uremia
    correctAns: GFR < 15 ml/min or symptoms of uremia
  - questionInfo: What are some potential complications that patients may experience
      during dialysis sessions?
