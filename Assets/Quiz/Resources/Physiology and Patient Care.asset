  questions:
  - questionInfo: Describe the concept of "Kt/V" in dialysis and its significance
      in assessing dialysis adequacy.
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Kt/V is the measure of potassium levels in the blood after dialysis.
    - Kt/V is the ratio of blood flow to dialysate flow during hemodialysis.
    - Kt/V is the clearance of urea during dialysis and is used to assess the effectiveness
      of dialysis in removing waste products.
    - Kt/V is the volume of fluid removed from the body during peritoneal dialysis.
    correctAns: Kt/V is the clearance of urea during dialysis and is used to assess
      the effectiveness of dialysis in removing waste products.
  - questionInfo: How does renal osteodystrophy develop in patients undergoing long-term
      dialysis, and what interventions can be taken to prevent or manage it?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Renal osteodystrophy is caused by excessive fluid removal during dialysis.
      It can be managed with vitamin D supplementation.
    - Renal osteodystrophy results from excessive potassium levels in the blood.
      It can be prevented by avoiding high-potassium foods.
    - Renal osteodystrophy is caused by inadequate phosphate removal during dialysis.
      It can be managed with phosphate binders and vitamin D supplementation.
    - Renal osteodystrophy is a congenital condition and cannot be prevented or managed
      through dialysis interventions.
    correctAns: Renal osteodystrophy is caused by excessive fluid removal during
      dialysis. It can be managed with vitamin D supplementation.
  - questionInfo: What is the purpose of administering erythropoiesis-stimulating
      agents (ESA) to dialysis patients, and what are the key considerations in their
      use?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - ESA stimulates urine production and improves kidney function.
    - ESA is used to control blood pressure during dialysis.
    - ESA stimulates red blood cell production and helps manage anemia in dialysis
      patients.
    - ESA is administered to prevent catheter-related infections.
    correctAns: ESA stimulates red blood cell production and helps manage anemia
      in dialysis patients.
  - questionInfo: How do dietary restrictions differ between patients on hemodialysis
      and peritoneal dialysis, and why are these restrictions important?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Patients on peritoneal dialysis need to limit fluid intake, while patients
      on hemodialysis need to restrict protein intake. These restrictions help maintain
      fluid balance and prevent protein loss.
    - Patients on hemodialysis need to restrict fluid intake, while patients on peritoneal
      dialysis need to limit potassium intake
    - Both patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis need to avoid high-phosphate
    - Both patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis need to avoid high-phosphate
    correctAns: Patients on peritoneal dialysis need to limit fluid intake, while
      patients on hemodialysis need to restrict protein intake. These restrictions
      help maintain fluid balance and prevent protein loss.
  - questionInfo: In the context of dialysis, what are "vascular access" complications,
      and how can they be prevented?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    videoClip: {fileID: 0}
    options:
    - Vascular access complications refer to difficulties in obtaining a blood sample
      for laboratory tests. They can be prevented by using specialized needles.
    - Vascular access complications are problems related to the catheter placement
      in the peritoneal cavity. They can be prevented by regular catheter flushes.
    - Vascular access complications involve issues with the access site
    - ' Vascular access complications are related to the use of high flow rates during
      peritoneal dialysis, and they can be prevented by adjusting the dialysate flow.'
    correctAns: Vascular access complications involve issues with the access site
